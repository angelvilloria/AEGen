# AEGEN
AEGEN stands for Automated Exam Generator System.

The system helps the professor to item analyze an item in a questionnaire. Also, the professor can create a test questionnaire by generating it from the data bank which can also be downloaded instantly or saved in the archive of the system.

The admin can only add the user and modify its information, as well as the course syllabus.
